      <h1>OFFLINE - The Digital Divide</h1>
      <p>
        In this game, you play the role of a benevolent Internet service provider in the fictional country of Bitland.
        You must attempt to connect as many of its inhabitants to the Internet as possible while taking into account budget restrictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each circle represents a town, or part of a city.
        A green circle represents an area that is connected to the Internet. A gray circle represents an area that is not connected.
        To connect one area of Bitland to another area, click and drag to draw a line from an area connected to the Internet to an area that is not connected.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have a limited amount of money available for you to use in expanding your reach.
        When expanding, you pay a fee based on the distance between the areas you connect.
        An additional, fixed fee is also imposed to pay for infrastructure.
        You can then gain some money back for connecting new areas, indicated by the number on the area.
        However, not all areas cannot afford to pay for the new infrastructure, so you may also lose money for connecting them.
        If you run out of money, the game is over.
      </p>
      <p>
        While money is a factor, your goal is not to maximize profits, but to expand Internet access to as many areas as possible.
        Be aware, however, that expanding to all areas is often impossible.
